# BR20

Chip series targeted to really low cost devices, usually these chips do not contain a flash chip embedded into the package, the only programmable storage they are left with is a 64k OTP PROM.
But sometimes there are some chips of this series that have an actual flash chip, too.

- Series: **AC691N**
- CPU Core: [pi32](../../cpu/index.md#pi32)
- SRAM: some
- MaskROM: I think it's huge (256k?)
- 'OTP' PROM: 64k
