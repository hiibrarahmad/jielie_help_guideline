# ISP_KEY

The `ISP_KEY` is used as an alternative way to the software-driven [USB_KEY](../usb/usb-key.md) or [UART_KEY](../uart/uart-key.md) bootloader enter methods that allows
to enter these bootloaders in some special cases that might be not handled in the Mask ROM. (e.g. running off the builtin LRC oscillator instead of a bluetooth oscillator)
